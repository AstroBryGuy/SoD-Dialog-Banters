# SoD Dialogue Banters
A BG:SoD mod by AstroBryGuy


## Introduction

This mod changes the Siege of Dragonspear NPC banter dialogues from the "on-the-run" style used in SoD to the pausing dialogue format used in BG1 and BG2.

The mod does *not* change the style of the compliment/insult NPC interactions. Those remain in the "on-the-run" style, as was done for these types of interactions in BG1.


## Installation
